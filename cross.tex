\section{cross classification}

% Ok but it will not be not very usefull if we cannot use the classifier for something new line another project or a new component.
% We start to check it for the cross-component classification.
% For each component, we exclude it and use it as the test set.
% We continue to have a high probability of detection with a not negligible probability of false alarm.
% Excepted for Foundation in CARDAMOM. Its because there is only one ARB that is unfortunately not detected. In fact There are a few ARBs reported in CARDAMOM

 Results of classifier when we exclude a component and use it as a test set:
 \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l l|r r r}
   Project & Component & PD & PF & Bal\\
   \hline
   Linux & Network drivers & 88.9 & 41.7 & 69.5\\
    & SCSI drivers & 75.0 & 27.6 & 73.7\\
    & EXT3 & 100.0 & 52.2 & 63.1\\
    & IPv4 & 100.0 & 52.2 & 63.1\\
   \hline
   MySQL & InnoDB & 65.6 & 16.5 & 73.0\\
    & Replication & 100.0 & 28.6 & 79.8\\
    & Optimizer & 100.0 & 69.7 & 50.7\\
   \hline
   CARDAMOM & Foundation & 0.0 & 0.0 & 29.3\\
    & Load Balancing & 100.0 & 9.0 & 93.7\\

%SCSI = Small Computer System Interface. Bus connecting the computer to peripherics or computers

% And finally, the more interesting, the cross-project classification.
% For each project, we use it as the training set and computes the statistics for the two others separately.
% We keep a high probability of detection between Linux and MySQL but not for the CARDAMOM. Whether its the training set or not.
% Its because the difference between it and the two other. The kind is not the same. CARDAMOM is in pure C++ while Linux is in C and MySQL a mix between C and C++.

 Results of classifier when the training set comes from another project than the test set:
 \begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{l|r r r|r r r|r r r}
  Train & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Linux} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{MySQL} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{CARDAMOM}\\
  ~ & PD & PF & Bal & PD & PF & Bal & PD & PF & Bal\\
  \hline
  Linux & - & - & - & 82.9 & 23.8 & 79.3 & 0.0 & 0.2 & 29.3\\
  MySQL & 100.0 & 50.7 & 64.2 & - & - & - & 33.3 & 11.8 & 52.1\\
  CARDA & 0.0 & 0.1 & 29.3 & 0.0 & 0.6 & 29.3 & - & - & -\\
  \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \end{center}
 Low performance with CARDAMOM due to the difference of caracteristics between CARDAMOM and the two others.
 \begin{center}
  (CARDAMOM in pure C++, MySQL in mixed C/C++, Linux in pure C)
 \end{center}
\end{frame}
%The language is not the only different caracteristics of course.
