\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Aging-related bugs}

%Firstly, let's introduce the mandelbug. Its a set of bugs.
%This is a bug that we cannot isolate between two println.
%For example, it occurs some time after the fault activation or occurs with a sequence of operation or even external interactions.
\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Aging-Related Bugs}
 \framesubtitle{Mandelbug}
 If
 \begin{itemize}
  \item A time lag between the fault activation and the failure occurence.
  \item Bug influenced by timing of operations or order of operations or environment interactions.
 \end{itemize}
 \vspace{1cm}
 \begin{tabular}{llll}
  Then & $\Longrightarrow$ & \emph{Mandelbug} & :-( \\
  Else & $\Longrightarrow$ & \emph{Bohrbugs} & :-) , can thus be easily isolated
 \end{tabular}
\end{frame}

%Aging-related bugs are a subset of Mandelbug: We can see the effect only for software that runs a long time ago.
%More and more error messages or the probability of a crash that increases with the running time.

%They can be caused by a memory allocation without deallocation, like a malloc() in C without a free(). And that's the case of most ARBs.
%They can also be due to a numerical imprecision accruing over time.
%Or an increasing queue, like in a router and then causes lags.
%We also encouter one when executing unit test of pacman.
\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Aging-Related Bugs}
 \framesubtitle{Examples}
 \begin{exampleblock}{What can causes an ARB ?}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Numerical error due to rounding or imprecision accrue over time
   \item A malloc() without free()
   \item A queue continuously increased
   \item Size of ressource exceeded
   \item ...
  \end{itemize}
 \end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

%Those horrible aging-related bugs... It would be great to detect where they are. Can we ?
%The short answer is: select metrics then use a classifier !
%Fortunately, you know what is a classifier. And so you know remaining questions:
%Which attributes (metrics) to use? Perhaps creating news ? Which classifier? Is the generalisation good enough to use them for other projects ?
\subsection{How to detect}
\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{How can we detect them ?}
 short answer: \alert{Select metrics then use a classifier !}\\
 But, there are remaining questions about that solution:\\
 \begin{block}{Questions}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Which metrics to use ?
   \item New metrics ?
   \item Which classifier to use ?
   \item will be the classifier effective for all projects ?
  \end{itemize}
 \end{block}
\end{frame}

%In the study, we will do the experiment in 3 projects: Linux, MySQL and CARDAMOM.
%The data base is fulled manually.
\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Project used as training set}
 3 complex projects will be used.\\
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Linux
  \item MySQL
  \item CARDAMOM, a middleware for air traffic control systems
 \end{itemize}
 \vspace{0.2cm}
 ARBs are found manually.\\

% In conclusion, we can use the classifier for an inspection purpose.
% We save time by avoiding inspecting files classified as non-ARB-prone.
% But its usefull only if the classifier is trained with similar project. Similar in caracteristics and language.

\subsection{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Conclusion}
 Predicting ARBs with software metrics is possible.\\
 \vspace{1cm}
 High PD: We can avoid inspecting files classified as non ARB-prone.\\
 \vspace{1cm}
 We have to check if caracteristics are similar before using a classifier for another project.
