\section{Attribute selection}
\subsection{Impact}

%Perhaps some metrics are useless. Moreover, discarding a attribute metric could improve performance.
%A procedure to remove redundant attribute is to compute the info gain for each attributes
%and then in a decreasing order of attributes rank, add the attribute in the set and report classifier results.

 \end{center}
 For each project, sort metrics by \emph{Information Gain}:\\
 \vspace{0.2cm}
 \begin{tabular}{ll}
  $InfoGain(A_i)$ = & the number of bits of information obtained\\
   & by knowing the value of attribute $A_i$
 \end{tabular}
 \\
 \vspace{0.4cm}
 Then, in a decreasing order of $InfoGain(A_i)$, compute PD, PF and Bal with the NB+log classifier.

%For Linux, the maximum probability of detection is reached with the top 5 metrics and it stagnates from about the 25 first with approximatively the same probability of detection as top 5.

%The highest probability of detection is reached on the top 35 and then it stagnate with a bit lower value.

%Here we need at least the top 5 metrics. It reaches the highest on top 37 and then seems to stagnate with the same value than on top 5.

%We observe that the 10 top metrics are not the same for the three projects.
%We need 5 metrics at least but with all metrics, we have nearly the same results.
%To keep an attribute selection that keep good performance, we can keep all metrics we selected before.

  \item Top metrics not the same
  \item Need about 5 top metrics
  \item With all metrics, nearly the same results than with 5
